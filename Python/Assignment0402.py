    Welcome!\n
    The human pyramin is a way of stacking people vertically in a triangle. 
    It Looks like this:
        *
       * *
      * * *
     * * * *
    * * * * *
    Each person splits their weight evenly on the two people below them in 
    the pyramid. The row and column are each zero-indexed, so the person at 
    row 0, column 0 is on top of the pyramid, and person in center of bottom 
    line on the above picture is at row 4, column 2. 
    Enter the index of the people you want, with its row index and column index,
    this program will give you the total weight on one's back. Everyone in the 
    pyraimd is exactly 128 pounds.

    Enter nothing to exit this program at any time you want.
    \n''')
