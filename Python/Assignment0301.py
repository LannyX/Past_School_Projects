    Welcome!\n
    This program will allow you to test Goldbach's Conjecture.\n
    For any given threshold, it will print the first found equation that satisifed
    Goldbach's Conjecture for every even numbers starting with 4. If you see "No 
    match for" certain number, that means this number cannot be expressed as the  
    sum of two primes.(You know it will not happen in within 4 Ã— 10^18. So please 
    contact the author if you find so. Don't take all the credit or responsibility)\n
    You may reuse this until you wish to exit\n''')
