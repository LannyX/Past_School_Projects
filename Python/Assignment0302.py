    Welcome!\n
    This program will allow you to test wheather if a positive integer is a happy number 
    or sad number, as well as prime or non-prime.
    Follow the instructions and give the input, you will see the result. After input the
    number, hit enter to check the result. Input nothing and hit enter to exit any time 
    you want.\n''')
